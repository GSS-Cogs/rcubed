Serve CSV with the correct mimetype and char encoding.

Allow specialization of table2qb configs based on URL path (e.g. common / family).

Login via github credentials and commit back changes.

Deal with github branches.

Check consitency of table2qb configuration.

Show which datasets use which dimensions / codelists.

Allow editing of and addition of columns, components, codelists.

Allow registering of external concept schemes, dimensions and classes.

Create OWL class hierarchy mirroring SKOS concept scheme.

OWL Class Hierarchy needs hints for disjoint union.

OWL Class Hierarchy can add property restriction.

Need to be able to put dimensions into a property hierarchy.

Need to be able to express the range of dimension properties consistent with the property hierarchy.

Ability to reconcile SKOS concepts against Wikidata and store the results.

Ability to add arbitrary OWL assertions, e.g. IFP.

Ability to annotate SKOS concepts to say whether they're proper aggregates (look at XKOS).

Ability to add alt labels and define notation datatypes.
